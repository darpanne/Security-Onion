# Security Onion

## Objective
The **Security Onion** project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs using tools like Security Onion.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- **Security Onion**: Comprehensive platform for SIEM and network monitoring.
- **SGUIL**, **Squert**, **Kibana**, and **Logstash** for log ingestion, analysis, and visualization.
- Network analysis tools like **Wireshark** for capturing and examining network traffic.
